# Notion PrettyPrint
Experimenting with the new Notion API to build a LaTeX exporter for academic papers.  
Currently, content is exported to a `.tex`file. Users will need their own TeX environment to build a `.pdf` file from that. 
PDF export might be included in a post-1.0 version. 

## ðŸš€ Notable features
- Supported Block types:
    - Paragraph
    - Bulleted List Item
    - Numbered List Item
    - Headings 1-3
    - Image
    - Equation
    - Code
    - Table (only simple tables, not databases)
- Text can be styled **bold**, *italic*, <ins>underlined</ins>, ~~struck-through~~, `as code`, as equation 
or <span style="color:red">with font colors.</span>
- Blocks can be nested up to 4 levels deep.
- The mapping of Notion headings to LaTeX headings can be set manually 
to allow for pages that contain only subsections or entire parts of a larger document.
- Quotation marks are internationalized in accordance with a manually set document language. 
Text that is marked as code is excluded from this.

## ðŸ«  Current Limitations
Apart from the block types not supported at all yet, the following Notion features lead to unexpected behavior:
- Background color is ignored. See issue [#17](https://github.com/MalteRichert/notion-prettyprint/issues/17).
- Nesting of blocks is limited to four levels of nesting.
- Nesting of numbered lists is not styled as in Notion but in LaTeX default with labels 1., (a), i., A.
- All numbered lists currently start at 1, even if they start at some other number in Notion.
- Images are not indented. I think that's fine though.
- Tables of contents are ignored for now.
- Languages for i18n are currently limited to English and German. That is only due to laziness on my part though.
- Quotation is limited to two levels of nesting.
- In Notion, you can apply styling to inline equations 
(bold, italic etc.) without it having much of an effect. LaTeX actually displays these stylings which might lead to 
unexpected results, e.g. if you styled an equation in Notion and forgot about it.
- Notion code blocks are exported into the `listings` environment without syntax highlighting. 
If you'd like to add syntax highlighting to your code in LaTeX, check out the `listings` docs or the `minted` package.
- For tables, header rows and columns are not styled differently from the rest of the table.
